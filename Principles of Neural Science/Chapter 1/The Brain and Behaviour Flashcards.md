The pons, rostral to the medulla conveys information about ==movement== from the ==cerebral hemispheres== to the ==cerebellum==
<!--SR:!2025-02-06,1,212!2025-02-08,3,252!2025-02-09,4,270-->
The cerebellum lies behind the ==pons== and is connected to the ==brain stem== by several major fiber tracts called ==penducles==
The ==cerebellum== modulates the force and range of movement and is involved in ==learning and motor skills==
The midbrain, rostral to the pons, controls many sensory and motor functions, including ==eye movement== and the coordination of ==visual and auditory reflexes==
The diencephalon lies rostral to what?::The midbrain
<!--SR:!2025-03-24,27,289-->
How many structures does the diencephalon consist of?::2
<!--SR:!2025-04-14,48,309-->
The ==thalamus== processes most of the information reaching the cerebral cortex from the rest of the nervous system
The ==hypothalamus== regulates autonomic, endocrine, and visceral functions
What are visceral functions?::The physiological operation of the internal organs, or viscera
<!--SR:!2025-04-05,17,230-->
What autonomic systems compose the viscera?::Respiratory, circulatory, digestive and reproductive systems
<!--SR:!2025-03-27,30,270-->
The cerebrum is comprised of ==two== cerebral hemispheres
The heavily wrinkled outer layer of the cerebrum is known as what?::The cerebral cortex
<!--SR:!2025-04-10,44,309-->
The three deep lying structures of the cerebrum are the ==basal ganglia==, ==hippocampus== and the ==amygdaloid nuclei==.
The cerebral cortex is divided into four distinct lobes; ==frontal==, ==parietal==, ==occipital== and ==temporal==.
The basal ganglia participate in regulating ==motor performance==
The hippocampus is involved in aspects of ==memory storage==
The amygdaloid nuclei coordinate the autonomic and ==endocrine responses== of emotional states
The ==hindbrain== consists of the pons, medulla oblongata and cerebellum
The forebrain consists of the ==diencephalon== and cerebrum
The crests of the infoldings on the cerebral cortex are known as?::Gyri
<!--SR:!2025-06-03,79,289-->
The grooves of the infoldings on the cerebral cortex are known as?::Sulci
<!--SR:!2025-04-13,47,309-->
The ==frontal== lobe is largely concerned with short term memory, planning future actions and with control of movement
The ==parietal== lobe is largely concerned with somatic sensation, forming body image and relating it to extrapersonal space
The ==occipital== lobe is associated with vision
The ==temporal== lobe is associated with hearing and through its deep structures, the hippocampus and amygdaloid nuclei-with learning, memory and emotion
What is somatic sensation?::Perception of physical sensations that arise from the body's surface
<!--SR:!2025-04-06,18,230-->
Each hemisphere of the cerebral cortex is concerned primarily with sensory and motor processes on the ==contralateral== side of the body
<!--SR:!2025-04-11,45,309-->

The motor and somatic areas of the cortex are separated by the ==central sulcus==
<!--SR:!2025-04-02,17,269-->

**The First Strong Evidence for Localization of Cognitive Abilities Came from Studies of
Language Disorders**
==Wernicke's== area processes auditory input for language and is important for understanding speech
<!--SR:!2025-04-09,43,309-->

Wernicke's area lies near the ==primary auditory cortex== and the ==angular gyrus==
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,1,149!2025-03-26,7,209-->

==Broca's== area controls the production of intelligible speech
<!--SR:!2025-03-31,34,289-->

Broca's area lies near the region of the motor area that controls the mouth and tongue movements needed to form ==words==
<!--SR:!2025-03-30,33,289-->

Wernicke's area communicates with Broca's area via a bi-directional pathway called the ==arcuate fasciculus==
<!--SR:!2025-03-28,31,249-->

Wernicke postulated that language involves separate ==motor== and ==sensory== programs each governed by distinct regions of the cortex
<!--SR:!2025-04-08,42,291!2025-05-04,65,311-->

The region of the cortex that integrates auditory, visual and somatic sensations is known as the ==association cortex==
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,6,191-->

The precentral gyrus is concerned with what?::Motor function
<!--SR:!2025-05-08,50,251-->

The postcentral gyrus is concerned with what?::Sensory function
<!--SR:!2025-03-28,9,211-->

The cognitive processing for language occurs in the ==left== hemisphere
<!--SR:!2025-04-30,61,311-->

The reading of a single word produces a response in the primary visual cortex and the ==visual association cortex==
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,10,254-->

The hearing of a word activates the temporal cortex and the junction of the ==temporal-parietal== cortex
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,10,254-->

When subjects are asked to repeat a word presented through earphones or a screen, the spoken word activates the supplemental motor area of the ==medial frontal== cortex
