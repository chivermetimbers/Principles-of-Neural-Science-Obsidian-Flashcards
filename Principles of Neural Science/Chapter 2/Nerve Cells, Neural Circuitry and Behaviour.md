One key principle of the organization of the brain is that ==nerve cells== with similar properties can produce different actions because of the way that they are interconnected
<!--SR:!2025-05-13,58,318-->

It is possible to learn a great deal about how the nervous system functions by focusing on five main key features:

1. The structural components of individual nerve cells
2. The mechanisms by which neurons produce signals between and within nerve cells
3. The patterns of connections between nerve cells and between nerve cells and their targets: muscles and gland effectors
4. The relationship of different patterns of interconnection to different types of behaviour
5. How neurons and their connections are modified by behaviour

A typical neuron has four morphologically distinct regions, they are: :: Cell body, dendrites, axon, presynaptic terminals
<!--SR:!2025-03-28,12,238-->

The endoplasmic reticulum is an extension of the nucleus where ==the cells proteins are synthesized==
<!--SR:!2025-03-29,18,258-->

Dendrites are the main apparatus for receiving signals from ==other nerve cells==
<!--SR:!2025-05-03,48,298-->

The axon ==carries signals to== other nerve cells
<!--SR:!2025-04-23,43,298-->

The electrical signals that an axon conveys are known as?::Action potentials
<!--SR:!2025-05-21,66,318-->

Axons are insulated by a sheath of?::Fatty myelin
<!--SR:!2025-04-29,44,298-->

The gaps between each myelin sheath is known as?::Nodes of Ranvier
<!--SR:!2025-05-12,57,318-->

The action potential is initiated at the initial segment of the axon and propagates to the ==synapse==
<!--SR:!2025-03-24,5,238-->

The apical and basal dendrites are responsible for what?:: Signal input from other neurons
<!--SR:!2025-04-25,40,298-->

The action potential travels down the axon at speeds of?::1 to 100m/s
<!--SR:!2025-05-02,47,298-->

The amplitude of the action potential travelling down the axon remains constant at?::100mV
<!--SR:!2025-05-16,61,318-->

The action potential is regenerated at what point along the axon?::The nodes of Ranvier
<!--SR:!2025-03-24,8,278-->

The nerve cell transmitting an action potential is known as?::A presynaptic cell
<!--SR:!2025-05-17,62,318-->

The nerve cell receiving an action potential is known as?::A postsynaptic cell
<!--SR:!2025-04-26,41,298-->

What is the part of the presynaptic cell that transmits signals from specialized enlarged regions of its axon branches called?::Presynaptic terminal
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,12,278-->

The narrow space separating the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell is known as?::The synaptic cleft
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,16,302-->

The principle of dynamic polarization states that

	Electrical signals within a nerve cell flow in one direction: from the receiving sites of the neuron to a trigger region in the axon. From there the action potential is propagated along the entire length of the axon to its terminals.

The principle of connectional specificity states that

	Nerve cells do not connect randomly with other nerve cells in the formation of networks. Rather each cell makes specific connections - at particular contact points - with certain postsynaptic target cells but not with others. 

Unipolar neurons have a single ==primary process==
<!--SR:!2025-04-12,24,262-->

Unipolar neurons predominate in the nervous systems of invertibrates, and in vertbrates in the ==autonomic nervous system==
<!--SR:!2025-03-25,6,222-->

==Bipolar neurons== have an oval soma with two distinct processes
<!--SR:!2025-05-20,62,322-->

What type of cell is typically bipolar?::Sensory cells
<!--SR:!2025-03-23,7,262-->

Multipolar neurons predominates in the ==nervous== system of vertebrates
<!--SR:!2025-03-27,17,305-->

The extent of dendritic branching in multipolar neurons varies with the number of ==synaptic contacts== other neurons make with them
<!--SR:!2025-03-21,5,245-->

==Sensory neurons== carry information from the body's peripheral sensors into the nervous system for the purpose of both perception and motor coordination
<!--SR:!2025-03-24,8,265-->

What does the term 'afferent' mean?::Carried towards the CNS
<!--SR:!2025-03-21,11,285-->

==Motor neurons== carry commands from the brain or spinal cord to muscles and glands
<!--SR:!2025-03-27,17,305-->

Interneurons are divided into two classes, what are they?::Relay and local
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,12,285-->

==Relay== interneurons have long axons and convey signals over considerable distances
<!--SR:!2025-03-26,16,305-->

==Local== interneurons have short axons and form connections with nearby neurons in local circuits
<!--SR:!2025-03-26,16,305-->

How do Glial cells differ morphologically from neurons?::They do not form dendrites or axons
<!--SR:!2025-03-23,13,288-->

The glia in the vertebrate nervous system can be divided into two different classes, what are they?::Microglia and macroglia
<!--SR:!2025-03-27,11,288-->

Microglia are immune system cells that are mobilized to present antigens and become ==phagocytes== during injury, infection or degenerative diseases.
<!--SR:!2025-03-25,15,308-->

There are three types of macroglia, what are they?::Oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and astrocytes
<!--SR:!2025-03-24,8,268-->

Which macroglia are responsible for the formation of the myelin sheath around the axon?::Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells
<!--SR:!2025-03-21,11,288-->

Where are Oligodendrocytes found in the body?::The central nervous system
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,1,228-->

Where are Schwann cells found in the body?::The peripheral nervous system
<!--SR:!2025-03-26,10,268-->

Oligodendrocytes can envelop up to 30 axonal segments known as ==internodes==
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,3,208-->

Each ==Schwann== cell envelops a single segment of one axon
<!--SR:!2025-03-25,15,308-->

Upon myelination, Shwann cells and Oligodendrocytes influence axons by enhancing ==signal conduction== and by segregating voltage sensitive ion channels into distinct axonal domains
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,6,248-->

Astrocytes come in two main types, what are they?::Protoplasmic and Fibrous
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,1,228-->

Where are protoplasmic astrocytes found?::Gray matter
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,1,168-->

Where are fibrous astrocytes found?::White matter
<!--SR:!2025-03-26,16,308-->

What is an example of a reflex?::The knee-jerk reflex
<!--SR:!2025-03-20,4,289-->

When the tendon of the quadriceps femoris is tapped, the muscle is stretched and information regarding this change is conveyed by to the ==central nervous system== by ==sensory neurons==.
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,3,269!2025-03-20,4,289-->

In the spinal cord, sensory neurons form excitatory synapses with extensor ==motor== neurons that contract the quadriceps.
<!--SR:!2025-03-22,3,269-->

	The sensory neurons, act indirectly through interneurons, to inhibit flexor motor neurons that would otherwise contract the hamstring. This, combined with the activation of the quadriceps extends the leg.

Excitatory neurons do what?::Increase likelihood of firing

Inhibitory neurons do what?::Decrease likelihood of firing

Excitatory connections in the leg's extensor muscles cause it to ==contract==

Connections with ==inhibitory== interneurons prevent the antagonist flexor muscles from contracting

Feed-forward inhibition is common in mono-synaptic ==reflex== systems

In the knee-jerk reflex feed-forward inhibition is ==reciprocal==

When a motor neuron makes an excitatory connection with both a muscle and an inhibitory interneuron that inhibits the motor neuron, what is this called?::Feedback inhibition

**Signaling is Organized in the Same Way in All Nerve Cells**
How many different signals must each motor or sensory cell participating in a behaviour produce in sequence?::Four

	Almost all neurons can be described by a model neuron that has four functional connecting at excitatory synapses.

A model neuron has four functional components that create four types of signals, what are the functional components?::Receptive, summing, long-range signaling, secretory

The different kinds of signals generated in a neuron are determined by the electrical properties of what part of the nerve cell?::The cell membrane

	Every cell maintains a difference of electrical potential on either side of the membrane when the cell is at rest, called 'resting membrane potential'

In a typical resting neuron, the resting membrane potential is approximately 65mV, since the voltage outside the membrane is defined to be zero the voltage inside it is::-65mV

What two ions are involved in maintaining membrane potential::K+ and Na+

What type of molecule is responsible for pumping Na+ out of cells and K+ into cells?::Protein(specifically a membrane protein)

The cell membrane is selectively permeable to what ion?::K+

	A cell is said to be exciteable when its membrane potential can be quickly and significantly altered

A reduction in membrane potential is called what?::Depolarization

An increase in membrane potential is called what?::Hyperpolarization

Depolarization is ==excitatory==

Hyperpolarization is ==inhibitory==

	In the knee-jerk reflex, the physical stimulus activates specialized receptor proteins at the sensory neurons receptive surface. Stretching of the muscle activates specific ion channels, that open in response to the stretch of the sensory neuron membrane. The opening of these channels permits the rapid influx of Na+ ions into the cell which changes the membrane potential producing a receptor potential

The amplitude and intensity of a receptor potential depends on the intensity of the ==muscle stretch==
